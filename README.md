# sea-ice-extent
Sea Ice Extent prediction using historical data only

(Not a physical model.)


Uses prophet (https://github.com/facebook/prophet) for prediction.


Daily data from https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/sea-ice-tools/
From: "All daily (single day and five-day trailing average) extent values in one file, updated daily (Sea_Ice_Index_Daily_Extent_G02135_v3.0.xlsx)"


Do not rely/use this forecast as I am just a hobbyist forecaster.
